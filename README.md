# WarriorBots 6421 JAVA Bootcamp 2021
This repository contains the updated WPILib Project from the first Programming Bootcamp ever presented by WarriorBots 6421 on November 13, 2021.  The main goal was to present JAVA programing to interested team members. In the end it is hoped that each participant would be able to write a FRC JAVA project to drive a robot in both teleop mode, using an arcade drive, and autonomous mode, using a ```RamseteCommand```. 

The respository currently has three branches that can be used with the respository wiki as a self guided training.  The hope is each team member will create a new local project and in the end compare their code to these branches.
- `main` will be the code needed to drive a robot in teleop using arcade drive.
- `autonomous` will be the code needed to drive a robot forward using a trajectory.
- `autonomous-w-chooser` will be the cose needed to a robot on one of three trajectories.

# Other stuff for future bootcamps

Here are some suggestions on items that can be added for future bootcamps.

- Information on using WPILib Commands and Lambda notation

- More PID information for using on arms/elevators (position control) and shooters (velocity control)

- Use `SmartDashboard` and the different `put...()` methods to add data to the Shuffleboard

- Use `NetworkTableEntry` as an alternative to 'SmartDashboard.put...()` for more control of data placement to Shuffleboard.

  - Display `NetworkTableEntry` in tabs

- Use testInit() and testPeriodic() methods

  - Populate tabs for testing and troubleshooting?

- Use rumble function on controllers

- LEDs for driver assistance

- Using Git, Git Desktop and GitHub
